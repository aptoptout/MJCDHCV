              Graphic Design internship at RAAAF [Rietveld Architecture-Art-Affordances (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). During my internship at RAAAF I have had the 11/15 opportunity to work with the small team as a support for research and concept development. In this supportive role my conceptual thinking and ability to make links between subjects has been greatly challenged. Besides this I had my own set of  projects, some of which were going on for the whole internship, others were short of duration. Mostly these projects were focused on book design and other printed objects. The freedom to make a graphic-grid-based interpretation of their art and architectural work has been an interesting and great subject to work with. I kept on working for RAAAF for another year which is specified in the ‘PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE’ section.

              Graphic Design [DTP] internship at NoSuchCompany (Rotterdam, The Netherlands).  During this second internship I worked in a team of graphic designers that is part of  the Marketing and visual communication company NoSuchCompany. The company has over 30 employees which had a completely different dynamic in comparison to two-headed design studio I did my first internship. Despite the big size of the  company, I worked on a big amount of different projects. Ranging from making logos for Rotterdam-based shops or research consortia from the Erasmus University to designing whole yearbooks and making illustrations for the Unilever magazine. After my internship at NoSuchCompany I’ve spend several years still working with and for   them this will be addressed under the ‘WORK EXPERIENCE’ heading.
